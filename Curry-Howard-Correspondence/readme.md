A compact, practical plan to drop into the repository. 

It’s tailored so the knowledge-base contains only categories that have a clear Curry–Howard (proofs-as-programs / formulae-as-types / internal language) relationship to logics. 

Includes:
* (1) scope and goals,
* (2) a recommended data model and file layout,
* (3) the canonical category ↔ logic mappings to include, with references,
* (4) an ingestion / curation pipeline, and
* (5) concrete first tasks one can assign as issues.


Add canonical references for the mappings so one can check sources.
