A compact, practical plan to drop into the repository. 

It’s tailored so the knowledge-base contains only categories that have a clear Curry–Howard (proofs-as-programs / formulae-as-types / internal language) relationship to logics. 

Includes:
* (1) scope and goals,
* (2) a recommended data model and file layout,
* (3) the canonical category ↔ logic mappings to include, with references,
* (4) an ingestion / curation pipeline, and
* (5) concrete first tasks one can assign as issues.


Add canonical references for the mappings so one can check sources.

Project scope & goals

    Scope: add, standardize, and interlink entries for categories that serve as models of logics (via Curry–Howard or its extensions) — e.g. cartesian closed categories, locally cartesian closed categories, *-autonomous categories, toposes, categories-with-families, monoidal closed categories, etc. 
    Exclude categories that have no recognized correspondence to a logic/lambda calculus.

    Goals:

        For each category, document the category-theoretic definition, associated logic(s), and the precise Curry–Howard mapping (what syntactic constructors correspond to which categorical structure).

        Provide canonical examples, references (papers, arXiv, books), and links to formalizations (Coq/Agda/Lean) when available.

        Make the dataset machine-readable (JSON-LD / YAML / RDF) so other projects (MathGloss, Mathoscope, MathNLI, etc.) can ingest it.

        Provide clear “how to use” docs and issue/PR templates so the community can add further validated entries.

    Why this is useful: makes explicit the web of models for programming-language and logic phenomena; helpful for researchers building formalizations, semantics, or educational material.
