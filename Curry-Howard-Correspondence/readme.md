A compact, practical plan to drop into the repository. 

It’s tailored so the knowledge-base contains only categories that have a clear Curry–Howard (proofs-as-programs / formulae-as-types / internal language) relationship to logics. 

Includes:
* (1) scope and goals,
* (2) a recommended data model and file layout,
* (3) the canonical category ↔ logic mappings to include, with references,
* (4) an ingestion / curation pipeline, and
* (5) concrete first tasks one can assign as issues.


Add canonical references for the mappings so one can check sources. 

------------------------------------------

Project scope & goals

    Scope: add, standardize, and interlink entries for categories that serve as models of logics (via Curry–Howard or its extensions) — e.g. cartesian closed categories, locally cartesian closed categories, *-autonomous categories, toposes, categories-with-families, monoidal closed categories, etc. 
    Exclude categories that have no recognized correspondence to a logic/lambda calculus.

    Goals:

       * For each category, document the category-theoretic definition, associated logic(s), and the precise Curry–Howard mapping (what syntactic constructors correspond to which categorical structure).

       * Provide canonical examples, references (papers, arXiv, books), and links to formalizations (Coq/Agda/Lean) when available.

       * Make the dataset machine-readable (JSON-LD / YAML / RDF) so other projects (MathGloss, Mathoscope, MathNLI, etc.) can ingest it.

       * Provide clear “how to use” docs and issue/PR templates so the community can add further validated entries.

    Why this is useful: makes explicit the web of models for programming-language and logic phenomena; helpful for researchers building formalizations, semantics, or educational material.

Recommended repository layout and data model

Suggested new top-level folders (minimal, composable):

/files/               # existing content area (repo already uses files/)
  index.md
  categories/         # one file per category (markdown + frontmatter)
  logics/             # short pages describing the logics
  mappings/           # JSON-LD/YAML files: explicit Curry–Howard mappings
  examples/           # concrete examples and formalization links
  bibliographies/     # bibtex / recommended reading per entry
  templates/          # PR/Issue/entry templates

Mapping files

    mappings/ccc-mapping.yaml — record the exact syntactic ↔ categorical correspondence and short equational laws used in the proof.

    Use JSON-LD context so later you can export RDF/OWL if desired for semantic-web linking.
