<h2> Logic Systems</h2>

This page is the actual full page of serious references. If you are looking for just a few systems but lots of flashy diagrams, 
you want http://www.cc.utah.edu/~nahaj/logic/structures/ which also gives an explaination of notations used and other housekeeping information.

This started as a list of Modal Logic systems I encountered. 
In the end it is a list of mostly modal logic systems. (But even at that, the list has grown LARGE.) 
Dr. Peter Suber has a list of the types of logics that covers the various types. 
It provides a bibliography of the various kinds of logics for a much wider class of logics than I cover, but no cross references of alternate names, and few individual representitives.

This list documents the fact that many systems have been investigated under different names, 
and that some names have historically been applied to several different systems. 
I'm not aware of any other such cross reference on the net (or anywhere else). If you are aware of such a reference, please drop me a line.

"To do" list

    Systems originally added (many years ago) don't have, and do need, references more like the more modern ones have.
    In cases where two axiomatizations of the same system have different extensions when a new axiom is added, these pages may have them with the same extension. Some of the cases I can blame on the original quoted authors, some are my own sloppyness. I'm working to get these fixed. (Thanks to Petr Pudlák for reminding me of the issue.)(Hughes and Cresswell cover the issue in passing several times.)
    I need to be more careful about noting which ones were originally presented as axiom schemata, but are presented as axioms here.
    I need to hunt down more original sources, so that presentations can be made to agree with those sources. (Since, for example, Hughes and Cresswell present axioms even in cases where the original was in terms of axiom schemata.)
    I am aware of maybe twice as many named logics than appear on these pages. And I seem to be always finding new ones. And new ones are being published all the time. There will always be something to do.
    A number of mappings between paraconsistent, relevant, and modal logics have recently been brought to my attention. The containment questions have expanded greatly.
    Some early pages seem to have some confusion between the purely implicational fragment of a system and the system formed by using only the system's axioms for implication.

Community Requests

Large numbers of researchers have "pet problems" about some particular system they are working on. These include those looking for decision procedures (or proof there isn't one), completeness (or proof it isn't complete), etc. I've added a "Community Requests" section to some pages where specific questions about the system and who's looking for an answer.

If you are a researcher, and you want such a note added for a system you are working on, please contact John.Halleck@utah.edu .
