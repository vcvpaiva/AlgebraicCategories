Logic Bibliography
John Halleck


Obviously I got the information on these pages from various other sources. Modal logic is a community effort, and very few people have intimate knowledge of many of the byways.

Here is a bibliography that may help. It includes essentially all the sources that I used to build these pages, and includes pointers to the on-line versions if I know where they are. 
[Some are commercial, but in cases where many universities subscribe, I have still included the pointers since they will be useful for a good body of the people interested.]

Much of the information originally on these pages came from [Hughes and Cresswell, 1968] but not all the relationships documented there have made it to here. 
As this project expanded, I was aided by information provided by many others, including Dr. Max Cresswell, Dr. Ken Pledger, Dr. Dolph Ulrich, Dr. Bangs Tapscott, and many many others. 
My special thanks to Doctors Cresswell and Pledger, who have saved me a great deal of work over the years by emailing answers to my many questions. 
And very special thanks to Dr. Bangs Tapscott, who introduced me to Modal Logic, and recently gave me his collection of hard to find original Modal Logic papers 
as he gave up Modal Logic and took up Blue Grass Music.

My references are often not the "best" reference to a given logic system, but merely where I found some relationship documented. 
I am actively looking for the "best" references for many of the systems. (And slowly working my way through old papers to use the "original" sources.)

If you are just starting out, I'd personally recommend [Hughes and Cresswell, 1996] or [Chellas, 1980] 
(The former being better, in my opinion, for the serious student. But I learned from [Hughes and Cresswell, 1968] and may therefore be biased.)

If you are looking for a complete bibliography, you are out of luck. 
For very early logic work, I can recommend the Journal of Symbolic Logic's complete bibliography for the years 1666-1936, 
"The Journal of Symbolic Logic", Vol. 1, No. 4, A Bibliography of Symbolic Logic, Dec., 1936

Note that some pages (most notably Lewis' S system's page) have their own bibliography.
