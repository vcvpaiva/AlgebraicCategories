# Logics

This page is intended to contain an alphabetical list of propositional and predicate logics that have been investigated in the published literature.

This list is still **very much under construction**, so feel free to add further logics, and to add information about individual entries.

Many of the propositional logics on this page have algebraic semantics given by a class of structures on the [http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php/|main page](http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php/|main_pages.md). Algebraic logic is the area that investigates the connections between logics and their algebraic counterparts.
