First-order logic—also called predicate logic, predicate calculus, quantificational logic—
is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. 
First-order logic (FOL) uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, 
and allows the use of sentences that contain variables. 
Rather than propositions such as "all men are mortal", in first-order logic one can have expressions 
in the form "for all x, if x is a man, then x is mortal"; where "for all x" is a quantifier, 
x is a variable, and "... is a man" and "... is mortal" are predicates.
