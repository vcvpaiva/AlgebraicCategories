Multivalued logic 

Many-valued logic (also multi- or multiple-valued logic) is a propositional calculus in which there are more than two truth values. 
Traditionally, in Aristotle's logical calculus, there were only two possible values (i.e., "true" and "false") for any proposition. 
Classical two-valued logic may be extended to n-valued logic for n greater than 2. 
Those most popular in the literature are three-valued (e.g., ≈Åukasiewicz's and Kleene's, which accept the values "true", "false", and "unknown"), 
four-valued, nine-valued, the finite-valued (finitely-many valued) with more than three values, and the infinite-valued (infinitely-many-valued), 
such as fuzzy logic and probability logic.
