Linear Logic

Linear logic is a substructural logic proposed by French logician Jean-Yves Girard as a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic, 
joining the dualities of the former with many of the constructive properties of the latter. Linear logic lends itself to many different presentations, explanations, and intuitions. 
Proof-theoretically, it derives from an analysis of Gentzen's sequent calculus in which uses of (the structural rules) 
contraction and weakening are carefully controlled.
