Arrow logic is a multi-modal logic that uses arrows to represent objects and their relationships. 
It's a general system that can be used in many different fields, including computer science, linguistics, and philosophy. 

How arrow logic works

    Arrow logic is based on the idea that objects can be represented by arrows in a picture. 

The logic of transitions, or arrow logic, can be studied using modal logic and relation algebra. 

Arrow logic can be used to formulate notions from various disciplines, such as economics, computer science, and cognitive science. 

Examples of arrow logic 

    Vectors: In mathematics, an arrow can represent a vector.
    Programs: In computer science, an arrow can represent a program.
    Text: In linguistics, an arrow can represent the dynamic meaning of a piece of text.
    Actions: In philosophy, an arrow can represent an agent's action. 

History of arrow logic
Arrow logic was developed by Johan van Benthem and Yde Venema as a way to describe the logic of transitions.
