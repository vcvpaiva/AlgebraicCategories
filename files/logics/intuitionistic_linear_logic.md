Linear logic is a substructural logic proposed by French logician Jean-Yves Girard as a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic.
Intuitionistic Linear Logic (ILL) is the intuitionnistic restriction of linear logic: the sequent calculus of ILL is obtained from the the 
2-sided sequent calculus for Linear Logic by restricting to one or less occurences of a formula on the right-handed side of the sequent.
