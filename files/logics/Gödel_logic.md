Gödel logic

A Gödel logic, sometimes referred to as "Dummett logic" or "Gödel–Dummett logic" is a member of a family of finite- or infinite-valued logics
in which the sets of truth values V are closed subsets of the unit interval [0,1] containing both 0 and 1. 
Different such sets V in general determine different Gödel logics.
