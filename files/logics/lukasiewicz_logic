Łukasiewicz logic  is a non-classical, many-valued logic. 
It was originally defined in the early 20th century by Jan Łukasiewicz as a three-valued modal logic.
It was later generalized to n-valued (for all finite n) as well as to infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first order.
