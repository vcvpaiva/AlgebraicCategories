Temporal logic

Temporal Logics are a rich variety of logical systems designed for formalising reasoning about time, 
and about events and changes in the world over time. These systems differ by the ontological assumptions 
made about the nature of time in the associated models, by the logical languages involving various operators for 
composing temporalized expressions, and by the formal logical semantics adopted for capturing the precise intended meaning 
of these temporal operators.
