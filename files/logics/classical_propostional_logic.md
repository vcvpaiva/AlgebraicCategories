Classical propositional logic

Classical Propositional Logic, or the Propositional Calculus, is a formal logic for reasoning about propositions, that is, 
atomic declarations that have truth values.
This system analyzes the relationship between the truth of statements. 
The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic is classical truth-functional propositional logic,
in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, the truth value of true or the truth value of false.
The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld. By comparison with first-order logic, 
truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be zeroth-order logic.
