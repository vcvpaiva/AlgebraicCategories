Categorial grammar is a family of formalisms in natural language syntax that share the central assumption 
that syntactic constituents combine as functions and arguments. 
One fundamental system of this kind is the so-called ‘Lambek Calculus’, 
whose type-change rules show a close similarity with the inference rules of non-commutative intuitionistic LinearLogic.

The calculus was originally described by Lambek in `The mathematics of sentence structure', Amer. Math. Monthly 65, 154–170 (1958).
A fundamental result was proved by Mati Pentus, who has shown that the Lambek calculus has the generative capacity of context-free grammars.
